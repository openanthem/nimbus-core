The Nimbus Framework is a Java/Spring based platform dedicated to building highly configurable, workflow driven, and rich single page web applications through the use of configuration written atop the Java Virtual Machine. The intent of the Nimbus Framework is to provide support for software engineers in creating new applications based on current and emerging best practices by creating a flexible, expandable product that can grow and change as its customerâ€™s needs change while minimizing the need to rewrite large sections of the code and while minimizing the overall cost of change.

# Development Overview
Building complex single page web applications as a Java developer has never been easier. The following "Java configuration" is all that is needed to configure a Nimbus web application.

```java
@Domain(value = "homepage", includeListeners = { ListenerType.websocket })
@Repo(value = Repo.Database.rep_none, cache = Repo.Cache.rep_device)
@ViewRoot(layout = "")
@Getter @Setter
public class VRHomepage {

    @Page(defaultPage = true)
    private VPMain vpMain;

    @Model @Getter @Setter
    public static class VPMain {

        @Tile
        private VTMain vtMain;
    }

    @Model @Getter @Setter
    public static class VTMain {

        @Section
        private VSMain vsMain;
    }

    @Model @Getter @Setter
    public static class VSMain {

        @Label("Hello World!")
        @Paragraph
        private String hello;
    }
}
```

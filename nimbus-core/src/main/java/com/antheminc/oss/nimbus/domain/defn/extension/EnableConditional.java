/**
 * <p>
 * &#64;{@code EnableConditional} is an extension capability provided by the
 * framework. The annotation is used to conditionally toggle the enabled
 * property on the param represented by the decorated field based on a SpEL
 * condition. The Framework provides default event handling for this annotation
 * during the {@code onStateChange} and {@code onStateLoad} events.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following sample code shows how to configure a field using
 * &#64;{@code EnableConditional} by setting the visibility property of the
 * param represented by {@code sectionG} based on the state of
 * {@code enableSectionG}.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#64;CheckBox(postEventOnChange = true)
 * &#64;EnableConditional(when = "state != 'true'", targetPath = "/../sectionG")
 * private String enableSectionG;
 * 
 * private SectionG sectionG;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This annotation can be triggered for multiple events by providing one or more
 * values for {@code targetPath} and/or multiple &#64;{@code EnableConditional}
 * annotations.
